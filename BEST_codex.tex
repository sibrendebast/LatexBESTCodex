\section{The Rules}
\label{sec:rules}

A cantus is an old Belgian traditional night where students come together to sing and drink. This does not happen in a random way, everything is organized by a set of rules.

\subsection{Where it all starts...}
\label{sub:start}

The evening starts when the ``Senior'' enters the room. He will be the chairman or the big boss for tonight. The Senior opens the evening with the words $$\text{``CANTUS IN''},$$ which is Latin for: ``the cantus has started''. Traditionally, the first song has to be the ``Io Vivat'' and we sing this standing up with our right hand on our heart.

\subsection{Verbum} 
\label{sub:verbum}

Because a cantus is about tradition and respect, you should always address the senior in a formal way. If you want to say something in public you must stand up and ask the senior: $$\text{``SENIOR, PETO VERBUM''}.$$ The senior agrees: $$\text{``HABES''}$$ or refuses: $$\text{``NON HABES''}.$$


\subsection{Silentium} % (fold)
\label{sub:silentium}

% subsection silentium (end)

If the senior says: $$\text{``SILENTIUM''}$$ everybody must stop talking and obey the silence. 

\subsection{Standing and Sitting} % (fold)
\label{sub:standing_and_sitting}

% subsection standing_and_sitting (end)

The senior decides when you can sit by saying: $$\text{``OMNES AD SEDES''}.$$ You reply with $$\text{"SEDIMUS"}.$$ When you have to get up the senior says $$\text{``SURGITE''}$$ and you say $$\text{``SURGIMUS''}.$$ 

\subsection{Tempus} % (fold)
\label{sub:tempus}

If you want to leave the table (e.g. to go to the toilet), you must ask for it $$\text{``SENIOR, PETO TEMPUS''.}$$ The senior agrees: $$\text{``HABES''}$$ or refuses: $$\text{``NON HABES''.}$$ You might have to perform a little punishment or make a `pissing rhyme' in order to go to the toilet.

% subsection tempus (end)

\subsection{Singing} % (fold)
\label{sub:singing}

The senior will sometimes point somebody who has to sing the first lines of a song… Alone! After the first couple lines, the senior will say ``AD OMNES'' and then everybody sings along. If you don't know the song, please be silent and listen how to sing the song. Afterwards you can sing along.\\

We don't always sing the whole song. The senior indicates which strophe will be sung: 

\begin{table}[ht!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ l|r}
Latin & English \\
\hline
Ad Primam & The first \\
Ad Secundam & The second \\
Ad Tertiam & The third \\
Ad Ultimam & The last \\
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:stropheindicators}
\end{table}

% subsection singing (end)

\subsection{Drinking} % (fold)
\label{sub:drinking}

If you don't drink beer, you must mention this at the beginning of the evening. In this case another drink can be arranged.
Sometimes (actually a lot of times) the senior will instruct you to drink. He will do so in Latin. He will say or sing the words: $$\text{``PROSIT CORONA''.}$$ You must then answer with: $$\text{``PROSIT SENIOR''.}$$ The senior can say this as many times as he/she wants and you have to repeat it the same way. In the end the senior will give a drinking command:
$$\text{``AD FUNDUM''}$$ The whole glass in one time or $$\text{``AD LIBIDUM''}$$ Which means how much as you want.\\

When the senior commands you to drink, you always say the following \textbf{before} you drink: $$\text{PROSIT SENIOR, PROSIT CORONA}$$

For example the senior will say: $$\text{``PROSIT CORONA, AD FUNDUM''.}$$ So you will reply with: $$\text{PROSIT SENIOR, PROSIT CORONA, AD FUNDUM!.}$$ 
After that you drink your whole glass. \\

If you want to challenge somebody to drink you stand up \textbf{during a song} and say \textbf{quietly}: $$\text{``PROSIT, X''.}$$ If X accepts the challenge X then stands and responds: $$\text{"PROSIT, Y".}$$ And you both drink an Ad Fundum. Do not do this in the beginning of a cantus as you must survive the evening. It is not allowed to challenge the senior or to disturb the cantus.\\

Nobody can force you to drink. You can stop drinking beer and ask for water AT ANY TIME. Drinking is fun, but if you drink too much it is less fun for you, as well as for the others! You can always switch to water, it's not a sin, sometimes it's wise!

% subsection drinking (end)

\subsection{Punishments} % (fold)
\label{sub:punishments}

If the senior decides that you didn't obey him or broke one of the rules of the cantus, you will be asked to come to the middle. This is called $$\text{``AD PISTUM.''}$$ There you will have to perform a small and funny punishment, unless you were really bad!

\subsection{Clementine} % (fold)
\label{sub:clementine}

In a cavern, in a canyon,\\
Excavating for a mine,\\
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner, \\
and his daughter Clementine.\\
\\
\textit{Chorus:\\
\\
Oh my darling, Oh my darling, \\
Oh my darling Clementine ! \\
Thou art lost and gone forever, \\
Dreadful sorry, Clementine.}\\
\\
Light she was and like a fairy, \\
And her shoes were number nine; \\
Herring boxes, without topses, \\
Sandals were for Clementine.\\
\\
Drove she ducklings, to the water,\\
Every morning, just at nine;  \\
Hit her foot against a splinter,  \\
Fell into the foaming brine.\\
\\
Saw her lips above the water, \\
Blowing bubbles mighty fine, \\
But alas I was no swimmer \\
So I lost my Clementine.\\
\\
In my dreams she still doth haunt me, \\
Robed in garments soaked in brine, \\
While in life I used to hug her, \\
Now she's dead I draw the line.\\
\\
How I missed her, how I missed her, \\
How I missed my Clementine, \\
But I kissed her little sister, \\
And forgot my Clementine.\\

The sun so hot I froze myself\\
Susanna, don't you cry.\\
\\
\textit{Chorus:\\

Oh! Sussana,\\
Oh! Don't you cry for me;\\
For I come from Alabama\\
With my banjo on my knee.\\}
\\
I had a dream the other night,\\
When everything was still,\\
I thought I saw Susanna\\
A coming down the hill.\\
The buckwheat cake was in her mouth,\\
A tear was in her eye\\

Susanna don't you cry.\\

I've been a wild rover \\
for many's a year,\\
I've spent all my money on \\
whiskey and beer,\\
But now I'm returning \\
with gold in great store,\\
And I never will play \\
the wild rover no more.\\
\\
\textit{Chorus:\\
\\
And it's no nay never, \\
no nay never no more,\\
Will I play the wild rover,\\
no never no more.\\}
\\
I went into an alehouse, \\
I used to frequent,\\
I told the landlady\\
my money was spent.\\
I asked her for credit, \\
she answered me nay.\\
Such custom like yours \\
I can have every day.\\
\\
I went up from my pockets\\
ten sovereigns bright,\\
And the landlady's eyes opened \\
wide with delight,\\
She says I have whiskeys \\
and wines of the best,\\
and the words that you told me\\
 were only in jest.\\
\\
I'll go home to my parents, \\
confess what I've done,\\
And I'll ask them to pardon \\
their prodigal son.\\
And when they've caressed me, \\
as oft times before,\\
Then I never will play \\
the wild rover no more.

\\
Oh you'll take the high road,\\
and I'll take the low road\\
And I'll be in Scotland before you,\\
But me and my true love will never meet again,\\
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomon'}\\
\\
I mind where we parted in yon shady glen,\\
On the steep, steep side of Ben Lomon'\\
Where in deep purple hue,\\
the Highland hills we view\\
And the moon coming out in the gloaming.\\
\\
The wee birdies sing and the wild flowers spring\\
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping;\\
But the broken heart will ken \\
no second spring again,\\
And the world does not know how we are greeting\\
